# SuperAdventureSync
First C# project to build a simple RPG following a tutorial.
Introduction to coding as a non-coder. Basic concepts are used and will expand the project as I learn. 
As of now the code is in multiple different files.
I've built an engine project in Visual Studio, which contains all the classes for the game (or the 'logic).
Seperately there is a designer solution in the project which includes the UI for the game.

# Now with Visual Studio Sync!
